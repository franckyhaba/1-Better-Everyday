# Write a Python script that:
# Reads a list of server names from a file called servers.txt.
# Pings each server once.
# Records the result (UP or DOWN) into a log file named healthcheck.log.
# Includes a function to format the log output.
# Uses a loop, lists, functions, and error handling.
# Prints a short summary at the end showing:
# total servers checked
# how many were up
# how many were down
